# Create a tuple for screen resolution
screen_res = (1920, 1080)

# Print current resolution
print("Current Resolution:", screen_res[0], "x", screen_res[1])

# ❌ Experiment: Trying to modify the tuple (this will cause an error)
# screen_res[0] = 1280

# ✅ Fix: Tuples cannot be modified
print("Tuples cannot be modified!")
